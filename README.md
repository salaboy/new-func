# HTTP Function Instance

Welcome to your new Go Function! The boilerplate function code can be found in
[`function.go`](function.go). This Function responds to HTTP requests.

## Development

Develop new features by adding a test to [`function_test.go`](function_test.go) for
each feature, and confirm it works with `go test`.

Once your function is passing tests, deploy it using `func deploy`.  The
`func` CLI also offers several other testing and development commands; see
`func --help` for more.

For more, see [the complete documentation]('https://github.com/knative/func/tree/main/docs')
